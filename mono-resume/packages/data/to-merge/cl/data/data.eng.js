	school_specific_text : `A ___ is something that I have wanted to do for several years now as it would allow me to enhance my current skills. I first became interested in programming when I studied Audio engineering at Fullsail University. This Bachelors played an integral part in developing my educational interest in physics, mathematics and technology. Upon completion of my degree, I had one goal and that was to continue my programming education. This is why I enrolled in both the Science hDip in Software Development at Maynooth University and subsequently the Masters in Computer Science at UCD. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of both programs from the outset. Throughout both degrees, I have had the chance to develop android applications, make dozens of websites and study a variety of widely used algorithms. I have pushed myself to be the best I can be at coding in numerous languages including Java, C++, SQL and Python.  I have also learned to use web development languages such as JavaScript, alongside html and CSS, to create dynamic web pages. In addition, I have set up several of my own cloud servers using node.js and Digital Ocean as the hosting platform for these projects. I know that a Masters in ___ will allow me to further develop my skills and reach my dream of attending such a world-renowned university as ___ . I am avid extracurricular person and like to keep my mind busy. One of the ways I did this was to enroll in the pilot program, Google CS First, to teach programming through Scratch at the local Maynooth primary school. I also accepted the opportunity to teach a group of young students to code at CoderDojo every week in Maynooth. Helping these students to understand coding was something that truly interested me and continues to give me immense satisfaction. In addition, I have attended and completed Maynooths coding hackathon competition that hosts Maynooths best computer science students.The modules in your Masters program really appeal to me, especially in the area of AI, cloud computing and cyber security.  Coupled with robotics, this is something that I would enjoy immensely and is a field I am keen to get involved in on completion of my Masters. This Master's program contains all the modules that interest me in computer science. The wide variety of choices available makes this  program truly stand out. I always find myself eager to learn as much as possible and try any of the new technologies available. Programming is something I want to do as a career, and I believe this wide module choice would be of invaluable experience. It would allow me to decipher which kind of role would be suited to my strengths, and be of interest to me among the current roles offered in the industry. The Masters course has pushed me to learn at a more rapid pace and to become very proficient at problem solving. I am passionate about coming up with creative solutions to difficult questions and would love the opportunity to continue to grow and develop my current skill set.  I have shown that in a very short space of time I have been able to not only complete assignments, but excel at them.   I know I want to continue learning computer science and would love the opportunity to do so at ___. This innovative program is uniquely flexible. I am extremely confident that the staff and alumni at ___  would be the best match to my learning style and allow me to reach both my career aspirations, and my full potential. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Gregoire Cousin`,
